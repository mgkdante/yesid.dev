# 18c — Decisions

> Populated during execution. Each D-entry amendment + probe-driven decision lands here with date + rationale.

## D-entry amendments locked at 18c start (from design spec)

| ID | Amendment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| D3 | Snapshot.yaml → directus-sync per-resource JSON files | Q6 + Agent A audit |
| D4 | + sessionStorage gate pattern (Agent D-#10) | Agent D |
| D5 | + Global Draft (v11.16) enabled; `REVISIONS_RETENTION=90d` | Q2 + Agent A |
| D6 | → `/shares` endpoint (not EDITOR_PREVIEW_TOKEN); `PreviewContext = { shareToken, version? }` | Q3 + Agent C |
| D7 | Unchanged (per-page block copies reaffirmed) | — |
| D8 | → Full-site revalidation (not per-URL) | Q5 |
| D9 | + `STORAGE_ASSET_TRANSFORM=presets` locked; + `legacy_path` custom field | Q10 + Agent A |
| D10 | + 2FA enforced admin + human-editor; SSO/OIDC NICE → SHOULD; instance-wide `RATE_LIMITER_*` | Q4 + Q12 + Agent C |
| D11 | → Zero custom extensions EXCEPT directus-sync | Q6 |
| D12 | → Turborepo monorepo **in existing yesid.dev repo** with two-app **independence convention** (amended from "strict boundary + CI check" on 2026-04-24; yesido-platform umbrella repo idea dropped — yesid.dev IS the umbrella; app independence enforced by code review + natural separation, not dedicated CI) | Major pivot (owner approved) + 2026-04-24 amendments |
| **D13** (new) | Turborepo + **Bun workspaces** monorepo (amended from pnpm on 2026-04-24 per owner directive — see Amendments below) | Monorepo pivot |
| **D14** (new) | `packages/shared` types + Zod only; runtime helpers stay app-local | Monorepo pivot + Q9 |
| **D15** (new) | Block Editor for all rich content (no Markdown interface anywhere) | Q1 + ripple |

## Probe-driven decisions (populated as probes land)

### P1 — Global Draft × Group interfaces (bug #26890)

**Decision (2026-04-24, deferred):** Runs at Task 49 (services retrofit) or 18i (first Group-using collection — block_* M2A). Interim working assumption: Global Draft works for flat collections (no Group interfaces) — services, projects, blog_posts, tech_stack, site_meta, route_seo. If Group field ever lands in these, probe immediately. Probe method: create throwaway `_probe_group` test collection via directus-sync, verify versioning behavior, delete. Not a 18c phase-entry blocker.

### P2 — /shares endpoint behavior

**Decision (2026-04-24, deferred per D6):** Adapter shape `PreviewContext = { shareToken, version? }` locked in 18c regardless. Full `/shares` endpoint probe (TTL / password / role-inheritance semantics) runs with post-Slice-18 preview routes implementation. Directus docs confirm enough for 18c adapter contract: token via `?token=<id>` header or query, `date_start/end` for TTL, optional password, role inheritance from creating user. Sufficient.

### P3 — Block Editor JSON shape

**Decision (2026-04-24, deferred to 18f):** No `blog_posts` collection exists in live CMS yet (only services migrated). Probing would duplicate 18f's opening scope. Interim assumption: Directus 11 Block Editor emits tiptap-style `{ type: "doc", content: [...] }` with heading/paragraph/list/code/quote/image/embed/hr/hardBreak nodes + bold/italic/code/link/strike inline marks. `BlockRenderer.svelte` design in 18f; `packages/shared/types/block-editor.ts` Zod schema authored at 18f Task 1. Nothing in 18c scope depends on exact shape.

### P4 — directus-sync on Railway

**Interim decision (2026-04-24 — local research complete, Railway verify owner-gated):** **Proceed with D3 + D11 amendments.** Extension `directus-extension-sync@3.0.6` verified on npm with Directus 11 host compat (`^11.0.0`). Dual-component architecture confirmed: CLI runs from CI; extension installed into Railway Directus image via minimal `pnpm add --prod --no-save` Dockerfile step (no custom EXTENSIONS_PATH needed — auto-discovered from `node_modules` via `directus:extension` manifest). Railway "image pull → Dockerfile build" flip is a documented dashboard switch.

**Owner verification gate (Task 17, not probe-blocking for phase entry):** `docker build` + `docker run` locally → confirm extension auto-loads; push Dockerfile to Railway staging service → confirm deploy green; run `npx directus-sync@3 diff` against staging → confirm CLI/extension handshake. If any step fails → revert D3 + D11 amendments; restore snapshot.yaml workflow.

**License note:** GPL-3.0 on the extension. We run as authoring tool only; don't modify/redistribute source. Template-extraction post-Slice-18 references `pnpm add` step, not source copy. No copyleft viral obligation.

### P5 — MCP system-prompt scope

**Decision (2026-04-24, complete):** **Instance-global scope confirmed.** Single field `directus_settings.mcp_prompt`; one prompt for all authenticated MCP callers. F14 writes ONE role-agnostic prompt, 250-400 words, covering yesid.dev scope + content-type overview + tone + Block Editor rule (no Markdown) + focal-point nudge + delete protection + translation conventions + Global Draft workflow. Land in Task 35 (`directus/settings.json`).

**Collateral fix:** Current prompt contains U+FFFD replacement character (same F1 Unicode corruption pattern as `snapshot.yaml:40`). F14 rewrite eliminates it; CI pre-commit should flag U+FFFD going forward to prevent regression.

### P6 — Turborepo + Vercel deploy

**Interim decision (2026-04-24 — local research complete, Vercel preview verify owner-gated):** **Proceed with D13 (Turborepo + pnpm workspaces monorepo).** Vercel documents exact auto-config for our shape (SvelteKit preset + Root Directory=`apps/web` + global `turbo run build` with auto-inferred filter + Output=`.svelte-kit/**` + `.vercel/**`). Env vars are project-scoped and split hosting (Vercel web / Railway cms) eliminates `apps/cms/.env` leak vector. pnpm workspaces + `workspace:*` protocol natively supported. SvelteKit adapter-vercel@6.3.1 + `nodejs22.x` runtime unchanged from current setup.

`packages/shared` ships TS source directly (no build step); SvelteKit's Vite 7 + Bun both handle workspace TS. Fallback if Vite refuses: add `tsc --build` emit (additive — no D13/D14 revert).

**Owner verification gate (Task 16 — not blocking phase entry):** Reconfigure **existing** Vercel project (yesid.dev) → Settings → change Root Directory from root to `apps/web`; env vars unchanged (already on project). Preview deploy on `feature/slice-18` → confirm SSR green + no env leak. No new Vercel project created; project ID + domain unchanged.

**Full research notes:** [`research.md § P6`](research.md#p6--turborepo--vercel-monorepo-deploy).

### P7 — Railway monorepo + directus-sync Dockerfile

**Interim decision (2026-04-24 — local research complete, Railway verify owner-gated):** **Proceed with D11 × D13 combination via Railway Option A (Root Directory=`apps/cms`, Dockerfile auto-detected at `apps/cms/Dockerfile`, Watch Paths=`/apps/cms/**`).** Build context = `apps/cms/` only — cleanest semantics; our Dockerfile doesn't COPY from outside subdir. Option B (`RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH` + repo-root context) held in reserve for future extensions that may need shared types.

Directus-sync CLI runs in CI (`pnpm dlx directus-sync@3 push`) and locally (`pnpm dlx directus-sync@3 pull`), NOT inside the Railway Docker image. `apps/cms/directus-sync.config.js` sets `dumpPath: './directus'` so files land at plan-target paths. Env vars per-service; no cross-app leak (apps/web deploys to Vercel, zero Railway presence).

P7's Railway verification is a **superset** of P4's verification — if P4 Railway deploy works on the sibling repo, P7's monorepo path is mechanically equivalent (just different build context root).

**Owner verification gate (Task 17 — not blocking phase entry):** **Existing** Railway service → Settings → Source → switch repo from `yesid.dev-cms` to `yesid.dev` + Root Directory=`apps/cms` + switch from image-pull to Dockerfile build → deploy from `feature/slice-18` → confirm `/server/health` + extension loaded + CLI handshake.

**Full research notes:** [`research.md § P7`](research.md#p7--railway-monorepo-deploy--directus-sync-extension).

### P8 — AVIF support

**Decision (2026-04-24, deferred to 18d Task 2-3):** Live CMS has 1 file (46-byte R2 smoke-test `.txt`) — no images to probe AVIF against. Deferral confirmed correct per design spec § D9 ("probe P8 in 18d"). At first image upload in 18d: `curl -I` with `?format=avif`; if `Content-Type: image/avif` → add AVIF variants to `seed-presets.ts`; if 400 → WebP-only stack, revisit post-Directus-12.

### P9 — Bun workspace + @repo/shared in SvelteKit + Bun

**Decision (2026-04-24, amended to Bun workspaces on owner directive):** **Proceed with D13 (Turborepo + Bun workspaces) and D14 (packages/shared as TS source + Zod).** `packages/shared` ships TS source directly via modern `exports` field; no `dist/` build step. SvelteKit 2 + Vite 7 + Bun 1.3 all resolve workspace-linked TS natively (Bun's symlink-free module resolver handles `workspace:*` protocol; Vite inherits Bun's resolution at build time; vitest + svelte-check share the tooling chain).

**Why Bun workspaces (pivot rationale):**
- Project is Bun-first throughout (`bun.lock` in existing `yesid.dev-cms`; all scripts use `bun` prefix).
- Bun 1.3.11 already installed locally; pnpm is NOT → single-tool dev ergonomics + no new tool install friction.
- Bun workspace installs are measurably faster than pnpm (relevant for CI matrix).
- Vercel + Turborepo both support Bun workspaces (Bun install auto-detected from `bun.lock`; `turbo run build` is package-manager-agnostic).
- `workspace:*` protocol supported in Bun 1.1+.

**Considered alternative (rejected):** pnpm workspaces. Pnpm's maturity and Turborepo-docs-default weight did not outweigh the consistency cost of introducing a second package manager to an otherwise Bun-native project. Template-extraction post-Slice-18 (`<your-org>/directus-sveltekit-pro`) ships with whichever workspace tool we finalize here; Bun monorepos are increasingly common in 2026 and Vercel's Bun support is GA.

**Root shape locked:**
```jsonc
// package.json (root)
{
  "name": "yesid-dev",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```
No `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. No `packageManager` field (Bun version pinned via `.bun-version` file or CI `bun-version` matrix input). `bun install` creates `bun.lock` at repo root.

**Fallback escalation ladder if in-situ verification at Task 14 surfaces issues (each additive; no D13/D14 revert):**

1. `tsc` cross-package inference errors → add `tsconfig composite: true` + project references.
2. Vite HMR flaky on packages/shared edits → `optimizeDeps.include: ['@repo/shared']` in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`.
3. Bundler tree-shake issues → emit `dist/` from `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` + flip `exports` to compiled paths.
4. Last resort → pivot to pnpm workspaces (`bun install` → `pnpm install` + add `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; ~1hr; documented as reverse of today's pivot).

D13/D14 revert only if the whole cross-app shared-package pattern collapses — extremely unlikely.

## Amendments during 18c execution

| Date | Amendment | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-24 | **D13 workspace tool: pnpm → Bun** (after P9 design research + P4/P6/P7 probe completion). Root package.json uses `workspaces` field (no pnpm-workspace.yaml). `bun install` at repo root; `bun.lock` committed. Vercel + Railway unaffected (both auto-detect from lockfile; Turborepo is package-manager-agnostic). Fallback to pnpm documented as reversible (~1hr) in P9 escalation ladder. | Owner directive post-P9 research: project is Bun-first throughout; single-tool dev ergonomics outweigh pnpm's Turborepo-docs-default weight. Bun already installed locally (pnpm was not). Vercel/Bun GA support eliminates deployment risk. |
| 2026-04-24 | **Monorepo umbrella: yesid.dev itself (no new repo).** yesido-platform creation dropped. Current yesid.dev root contents `git mv` → `apps/web/`; yesid.dev-cms subtree-imported to `apps/cms/`; yesid.dev-cms archived post-cutover. Existing Vercel project (yesid.dev) + existing Railway service reconfigured in-place (Root Directory changes only). Preserves domain↔repo-name parity + Vercel project ID + git history of both repos. | Owner directive: simpler, no new GitHub repo, fewer migration artifacts. Template extraction post-Slice-18 proceeds from yesid.dev the same way as it would have from yesido-platform. |
| 2026-04-24 | **D12 strict boundary → app independence convention.** Apps DO participate in workspaces (`workspaces: ["apps/*", "packages/*"]` — required for Turborepo task discovery + dependency hoisting). App independence enforced by: (a) `"private": true` on app package.json; (b) no app declares another app as a dep; (c) no `exports` field on app package.json; (d) code review catches cross-app imports. Dedicated CI lint rule (originally Task 15 scope) removed; YAGNI. `packages/shared` remains the only legitimate cross-app surface. | Apps must be in workspaces for Turborepo + bun install hoisting; mechanical enforcement via "private" + no cross-app deps + review is sufficient. |
| 2026-04-24 | **Added 18l sub-slice: CMS brand styling** (Data Studio theme matching yesid.dev brand). 0.5 session, between 18j and 18k. Directus-sync-authored themes + settings; logo + favicon upload via 18d asset pipeline. No new D-entries. | Owner directive: brand consistency across consumer site + CMS admin UI. |
